# text_adventure_game
Trying to make a python based adventure game.

using python 2.7 for this.

All of this is from my weird mind.


TO DO LIST:

*Make it replayable

*Use another file for checking multiple playthroughs

*make a better battle system

*more choices

*learn how to use classes (if someone could teach me that would be nice) 

*Music folder

*Credit musicians
